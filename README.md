# ActionScript 3: Reassigning Function to Null

This repository demonstrates a potential issue in ActionScript 3 related to reassigning a function to null.  While generally functions are not directly assigned to null, in certain scenarios (e.g., dynamic event handling, object pool management) you may accidentally null out functions causing runtime exceptions if those functions are referenced after null assignment. 

**Problem:**

In ActionScript 3, attempting to reassign a function reference to null after using it in a later code section will lead to runtime errors if that function is called again.

**Solution:**

Avoid assigning functions to null unless the function is never expected to be called again after the assignment. Consider using a more robust approach to managing function references, such as event listeners and conditional checks before invocation.
